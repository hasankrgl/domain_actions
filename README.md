# domain_actions

This repository includes basic/fundemental actions for an app server, web server and other technologies. In this example I used jboss eap, IBM IHS Web Server and IBM CTG. 
It can be used in ansible tower by showing the main.yml file as the main file and defining survey {{action}}, action name should be the same with the yaml file names.
